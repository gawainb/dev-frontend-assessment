While implementing the filtering portion of the assesment I noticed there was not a "Primary Exchange" property in the data model. Because of this I did not know how to move forward in implementing it in my filtering.

I also took advantage of the dropdown element within the "elements" folder that was already within the application. I noticed that it doesnt display an input box for selections.
